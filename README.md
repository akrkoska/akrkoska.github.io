This is my first project for the MIT "full-stack programming" course. :)

I created a portfolio-page on github and linked a website to it that should 
help the reader with creating their own portfolio-page.

**In the process of this project I learned:**
- how html documents are structured
- how to attach images
- how to attach a link
